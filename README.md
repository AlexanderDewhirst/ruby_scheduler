# Ruby Scheduler

Your product owner is asking you to implement a new feature in the calendar system
that is in your scheduling tool. The feature needs to support arranging a set of
meetings within an 8 hour day in a way that makes them work, and let the user know
if the meetings cannot fit into the day.

For this feature there will be two kinds of meetings, on-site meetings and off-site
meetings. On-site meetings can be scheduled back to back with no gaps in between
them, but off-site meetings must have 30 minutes of travel time padded to either
end. This travel time however can overlap for back to back off-site meetings, and can
extend past the start and end of the day.


# Use Scheduler
To add the scheduler to your Ruby on Rails project, add
```
gem 'ruby-scheduler', '~> 0.1.2'
```
to your Gemfile. Then run
```
bundle install
```

# Run Scheduler
To run the scheduler from the command line:
```
exec-scheduler
```
or 
```
ruby lib/ruby/scheduler.rb
```

# Tests
To run the tests suite
```
test-scheduler
```
or to run a specific test file
```
bundle exec rspec spec/lib/scheduler_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/lib/scheduler/meeting_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/lib/schedulder/schedule_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/helpers/scheduler_helper_spec.rb
```

# Examples

```
Given a set of meetings (below is an example of a set of meetings):
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 3, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 2, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 3”, duration: 1, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 4”, duration: 0.5, type: :onsite }
}
```

You must write code to determine if these meetings can fit into a 9 to 5 schedule,
and propose a layout for those meetings in a format like this:
```
9:00 - 12:00 - Meeting 1
12:00 - 12:30 - Meeting 4
1:00 - 3:00 - Meeting 2
3:30 - 4:30 - Meeting 3
```

## Here are a few example sets for you to test against:

Example 1:
```
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 1.5, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 2, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 3”, duration: 1, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 4”, duration: 1, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 5”, duration: 1, type: :offsite },
}
```
Yes, can fit. One possible solution would be:
```
9:00 - 10:30 - Meeting 1
10:30 - 11:30 - Meeting 3
12:00 - 1:00 - Meeting 5
1:30 - 2:30 - Meeting 4
3:00 - 5:00 - Meeting 2
```

Example 2:
```
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 4, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 4, type: :offsite }
}
```
No, can’t fit.

Example 3:
```
{
{ name: “Meeting 1”, duration: 0.5, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 2”, duration: 0.5, type: :onsite },
{ name: “Meeting 3”, duration: 2.5, type: :offsite },
{ name: “Meeting 4”, duration: 3, type: :onsite }
}
```
Yes, can fit. One possible solution would be:
```
9:00 - 9:30 - Meeting 2
10:00 - 10:30 - Meeting 1
11:00 - 2:00 - Meeting 4
2:30 - 5:00 - Meeting 3
```

## Instructions

. Write the solution in Ruby.

. Put the code up on Github, Bitbucket, etc…

. Commit early and often so we can see progress as you work through the solution.

. No need to create a complex UI, just a command line application is enough.

. The data samples can be hardcoded into the solution, no need to read in external
data.
